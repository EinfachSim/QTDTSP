# QTDTSP

Experiments to compute time-dependent Traveling Salesperson (TDTSP) solutions using Hopfield networks and quantum eigensolvers.

- `models.py` contains the general models for using the notebooks, e.g. a TSP and TDTSP class, HopfieldNetwork, a class for TemporalGraphs etc.
- `hopfield_tsp_test.ipynb` contains the first implementation of solving TSP using a Hopfield Network, see "Neural Computation of Decisions in Optimization Problems" (Hopfield, 1985)
